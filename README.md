# reverseShellPython
Check Readme

I have built a reverse shell while learning about network programming on YouTube Channel buildwithpython. I have commented the code alot for myself to take reference in the future as this is my first project in Network Programming. There are three files: client.py which is to be run in client's computer and two files for server one for connecting to a single client and one if you want to accept requests from multiple clients.
