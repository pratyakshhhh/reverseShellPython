# reverseShellPython
Check Readme

I have built a reverse shell while learning about network programming on YouTube Channel buildwithpython. I have commented the code alot for myself to take reference in the future as this is my first project in Network Programming. There are three files: client.py which is to be run in client's computer and two files for server. One for connecting to a single client and another one if you want to accept requests from multiple clients. 

The multipleconnections file uses a customised integerated terminal named "turtle". turtle have only two functions, one for selecting between multiple clients and one for displaying clients connected to our server. There is multithreading used in the program for establishing connnection with a new client and sending commands to old client simultaneously. 


Run the program in your and your freind's system and check the shit out! You can do anything in your friend's computer by knowing some linux/windows commands. Please check the code before proceeding with running the application.

Don't forget to change the IP in the cient.py file and replace it with your IP to make the client to be connected to you.

You can simply find your Ip address by cmd ipconfig in windows and terminal ifconfig in mac and linux. 


Have a great Day!
